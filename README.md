## Computer Science Story Game
This is my second computer science project, in which we were to write a choose-your-own-adventure story and write a program that prompts the user for input. This program was to go though the story, and have the user make choices. I chose not to hard-code it, because one of my friends suggested using `gson` to read the story from a `json` file. I thought it was a cool idea, and a good way to learn the `gson` library, so I agreed. His implementation is much more complicated than mine, but this is ok.
